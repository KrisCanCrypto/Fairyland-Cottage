## [User Stories](#user-stories)

I wanted a website for users old and new to able explore the world of _Fairyland Cottage_ without having to go to different sites / apps. If they wish to see more they have the option through our links provided.
On the home page we give a warming welcome note and a insight into simply living. This allows the new user to get a strong understanding of what information is available.

- ### Navbar

  The navbar for 768px & up is simple, clean and minimal. Containing links to each page while also the img logo returns the user to the home page at any point.

  The navbar for small devices, such as mobiles, transitions to a side bar to offer more screen real estate. This also toggles the page links by clicking the 3 dots ... As there is no footer on the small screens I have added the social links as part of the side bar. <br>

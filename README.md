  ### Font

  The font that I chose for the full site is [Josefin Slab](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Josefin+Slab). The reasoning behind this choice is to keep in form with the original font used for the existing [Fairyland Cottage website](https://www.fairylandcottage.com/) where Papyrus was the main font. Unfortunately google fonts did not offer this option, so I found a good [blog](https://appsthatdeliver.com/app-tutorials/google-docs/papyrus-font-google-docs/) that offered alternative fonts that held a similarity to the font design Papyrus.

  I wanted old users to feel that they where still in the world of Fairyland while new users where greeted with the organic earthly feel Josefin Slab offers while reading and browsing through the site.

## [Features](#features)

- ### Navbar

  The navbar for 768px & up is simple, clean and minimal. Containing links to each page while also the img logo returns the user to the home page at any point.

  The navbar for small devices, such as mobiles, transitions to a side bar to offer more screen real estate. This also toggles the page links by clicking the 3 dots ... As there is no footer on the small screens I have added the social links as part of the side bar. <br>

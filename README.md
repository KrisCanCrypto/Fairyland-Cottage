  ### Font

  The font that I chose for the full site is [Josefin Slab](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Josefin+Slab). The reasoning behind this choice is to keep in form with the original font used for the existing [Fairyland Cottage website](https://www.fairylandcottage.com/) where Papyrus was the main font. Unfortunately google fonts did not offer this option, so I found a good [blog](https://appsthatdeliver.com/app-tutorials/google-docs/papyrus-font-google-docs/) that offered alternative fonts that held a similarity to the font design Papyrus.

  I aimed to create a seamless transition for returning users, evoking a sense of familiarity with the world of Fairyland, while new visitors are welcomed with the organic and earthy aesthetic of Josefin Slab font, enhancing their reading and browsing experience on the site.

  <img src="assets/images/josefin-slab-example.webp" alt="appearance" width="500px" margin=" 0 auto"/>

  ### Icons

  - The icons I used are from the [Fontawesome]() Icon library using the <<i>i</i>> tag.

  - They are utalised is the footer on pages 768px and up. While added to the side bar on mobile devices.

  ![Icons](assets/images/icons-side.webp)

  ### Colors

  - I used the site [coolors](https://coolors.co/ded5cd-f3eae2-41462d-e9ead6) to create the color pallet.

  - I strive for the website to offer users a sense of rooted-ness and a strong connection to nature.

  - I selected the drab dark brown color to evoke a sense of organic connection to the earth, bridging the tones of the soil and forest greens. This choice allows it to contrast and stand out against the lighter hues present throughout the site.

  ![Website colors](assets/images/color-pallet.webp)

  ### [Images](#images)

  On the **landing pages** I chose two hero images.

  - The prime hero image displayed on the website with a viewport size of 768px and above features an exquisite portrayal of the cottage. This deliberate choice aims to imbue users with a sense of warmth and hospitality upon entering the enchanting realm of _Fairyland Cottage_.

    <img src="assets/images/house.webp" alt="hero image 768px & up" height="250" margin=" 0 auto"/>

  <br>

  - I selected a distinct hero image specifically tailored for mobile screens. The objective was to maintain a mystical and inviting ambiance while optimizing the vertical space available on mobile devices. The choice of a moss-filled tree with a subtle glimmer of sun rays effectively captures the desired atmosphere that aligns with the site's overall aesthetic.

    <img src="assets/images/smallscreen.webp" alt="Hero image mobile" height="250" margin=" 0 auto"/>

    <hr>

  On the **Contact page**, the goal is to evoke a sense of closeness and connection with the user through the imagery, emphasizing the contact form as a means to facilitate this connection. By employing a technique that emphasizes the foreground over a blurred image of Niamh, these visuals are carefully curated to convey a feeling of emotional proximity and engagement.

  - The **Contact page** image for 786px and up.

    <img src="assets/images/walking.webp" alt="Hero image mobile" height="250" margin=" 0 auto"/>

  - The **Contact page** image for mobile devices.

## [Features](#features)

### Page Elements

### **_All Web Pages_**

#### - Navbar

##### 768px & up Navbar

- The navbar design for screens 768px & up prioritizes simplicity, cleanliness, and minimalism. It effectively guides users with links to each page, ensuring easy navigation. Additionally, the inclusion of an image logo offers users a quick way to return to the home page from any section of the website.

  ![alt img](assets/images/navbar-768px.webp)

##### - [Sidebar](#sidebar)

- On smaller devices like mobile phones, the navbar adapts its layout to a side bar format to optimize screen space. This transition enhances the user experience by providing more visible content on the limited screen real estate of mobile devices. The sidebar design effectively organizes page links and can be toggled by clicking the 3 dots icon, offering a streamlined navigation experience.

- To further enhance usability on small screens, where space constraints may limit the visibility of a footer, social media links have been integrated within the side bar. This strategic placement ensures that users can easily access and engage with social media platforms without compromising the overall navigation experience on smaller devices.<br>

  <img src="assets/images/navbar-toggleoff.webp" alt="Side bar" height="600"/> <img src="assets/images/navbar-toggleon.webp" alt="Side bar toggle " height="600"/>

#### - Footer

- The footer features a simple and minimalist design to maintain consistency with the headers layout.

- Includes only social media links and website copyright information for streamlined navigation.

- Social media links direct users to separate webpages for YouTube and Instagram, opening in a new tab for enhanced user experience.

### **_Landing Page_**

The landing page displays one of two hero images located in the [images](#images) section of this README, with the image being dynamically selected based on the screen size of the device.

- There are also two text sections:

  1. The initial component comprises a salutation directed towards both new and returning users, accompanied by a succinct overview of the site's offerings & functionalities.

     <img src="assets/images/welcome-note.webp" alt="welcome note" width="500"/>

  <br>

  2. This section highlights the principles of a simple living ethos, emphasizing the importance of sustainable practices such as minimalism, waste reduction and renewable resources. It underscores the benefits of simplifying our lives, focusing on what matters most, and integrating nature into our daily routines to promote a more sustainable and fulfilling lifestyle for both individuals and the environment.

     <img src="assets/images/simple-living.webp" alt="Simple living ethos" width="500"/>

<br>

### **_Videos Gallery_**

Within the videos page, there are three distinct sections that cater to various aspects of the _Fairyland Cottage_ ecosystem. These sections are designed to support and promote the ethos of the simplified living ethos lifestyle.

**- Three dots**

In order for the user to switch between each video, they will need to utilize the three dots displayed underneath the videos. This functionality is exclusive to device screens with a width of 768px or larger. The presence of the three dots is intended to maintain consistency with the 3 dots icon located in the [sidebar](#sidebar).

![3 dots selector](assets/images/3dots.wbp.png)

<br>

**- Mobile devices**

For small devices, a revised layout has been implemented to optimize the horizontal orientation of mobile devices. This layout displays three available videos for user access.

<img src="assets/images/mobile-devices.webp" alt="Mobile video gallery" height="500"/>

<br>

**- Video Category's**

1.  The first video section intermittently presents a substantial challenge for some users, as they may lack the necessary information, support, or guidance to navigate this aspect effectively. In response, I have curated a selection of calming and motivational videos to ease users into the process and demonstrate that success in this area is within reach.<br><br><img src="assets/images/zero-waste.webp" alt="zero waste videos" width="400"/>
    <br><br>
2.  The second video section provides users with an illustration of the simplicity and benefits of a peaceful lifestyle. These videos offer a glimpse into a tranquil way of living.<br><br><img src="assets/images/video-section-2.webp" alt="Simple Living" width="400"/>
    <br><br>
3.  In the concluding video section, I have included content focused on a minimal lifestyle, as this step is essential in the process of relinquishing perceived necessities. These videos serve as a guide for individuals and families in achieving this outcome.
    <br><br><img src="assets/images/video-section-3.webp" alt="Minimal Lifestyle" width="400"/>

<br>
 <hr>

### **_Image Gallery_**

The primary function of the image gallery page is to provide users with a visual representation of _Fairyland Cottage_, showcasing moments frozen in time. Additionally, it serves as a source of visual relaxation for individuals who may prefer images over videos or have limited time to watch them.

**- Page layout**

The page layout dynamically adjusts based on the user's device.

- For devices with a maximum width of 1023px, the display is configured to be in a single column layout.<br><br><img src="assets/images/one-column.webp" alt="Mobile img gallery" height="400"/>

<br>

- For devices with a minimum width of 1024px and higher, the layout will adjust to a two-column display.<br><br><img src="assets/images/two-column.webp" alt="two-column display" width="500"/>

In order to optimize user experience, I have limited the display to a maximum of two columns to prevent users from being inundated with excessive visual information.

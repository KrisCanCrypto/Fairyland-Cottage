  ### Font

  The font that I chose for the full site is [Josefin Slab](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Josefin+Slab). The reasoning behind this choice is to keep in form with the original font used for the existing [Fairyland Cottage website](https://www.fairylandcottage.com/) where Papyrus was the main font. Unfortunately google fonts did not offer this option, so I found a good [blog](https://appsthatdeliver.com/app-tutorials/google-docs/papyrus-font-google-docs/) that offered alternative fonts that held a similarity to the font design Papyrus.

  I aimed to create a seamless transition for returning users, evoking a sense of familiarity with the world of Fairyland, while new visitors are welcomed with the organic and earthy aesthetic of Josefin Slab font, enhancing their reading and browsing experience on the site.

  ### Icons

  - The icons I used are from the [Fontawesome]() Icon library using the <<i>i</i>> tag.

  - They are utalised is the footer on pages 768px and up. While added to the side bar on mobile devices.

  ### Colors

  - I used the site [coolors](https://coolors.co/ded5cd-f3eae2-41462d-e9ead6) to create the color pallet.

  - I strive for the website to offer users a sense of rooted-ness and a strong connection to nature.

  - I selected the drab dark brown color to evoke a sense of organic connection to the earth, bridging the tones of the soil and forest greens. This choice allows it to contrast and stand out against the lighter hues present throughout the site.

  ### Images

  On the **landing pages** I chose two hero images.

  - The prime hero image displayed on the website with a viewport size of 768px and above features an exquisite portrayal of the cottage. This deliberate choice aims to imbue users with a sense of warmth and hospitality upon entering the enchanting realm of _Fairyland Cottage_.

    <img src="assets/images/house.webp" alt="hero image 768px & up" height="250" margin=" 0 auto"/>

  <br>

  - I selected a distinct hero image specifically tailored for mobile screens. The objective was to maintain a mystical and inviting ambiance while optimizing the vertical space available on mobile devices. The choice of a moss-filled tree with a subtle glimmer of sun rays effectively captures the desired atmosphere that aligns with the site's overall aesthetic.

  On the **Contact page**, the goal is to evoke a sense of closeness and connection with the user through the imagery, emphasizing the contact form as a means to facilitate this connection. By employing a technique that emphasizes the foreground over a blurred image of Niamh, these visuals are carefully curated to convey a feeling of emotional proximity and engagement.

  - The **Contact page** image for 786px and up.

  - The **Contact page** image for mobile devices.

## [Features](#features)

- ### Navbar

  The navbar for 768px & up is simple, clean and minimal. Containing links to each page while also the img logo returns the user to the home page at any point.

  ![alt img](assets/images/navbar-768px.webp)

  The navbar for small devices, such as mobiles, transitions to a side bar to offer more screen real estate. This also toggles the page links by clicking the 3 dots ... As there is no footer on the small screens I have added the social links as part of the side bar. <br>
